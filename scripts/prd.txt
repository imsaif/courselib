# Course Library - Original Product Requirements Document

**⚠️ NOTE: This is the original PRD. Active development now follows the [MVP PRD](mvp_prd.txt) for prototype demonstration.**

<context>
# Overview  
A modern web-based course library management system for educational institutions, specifically designed for Rwanda EQUIP. The platform allows educators to browse courses, manage teacher guides, and upload educational content. The system addresses the need for organized course materials, teacher guide management, and streamlined educational content delivery across different grade levels and subjects.

# Current Implementation Focus
This original PRD has been adapted into an MVP approach focusing on:

1. **Prototype Demonstration** rather than full production system
2. **Core Workflows** showing upload → review → approval process
3. **Simplified Authentication** for demo purposes
4. **Mock Data Integration** instead of complex backend systems

## Logical Dependency Chain - UPDATED
### ✅ Foundation Layer - COMPLETE
1. ✅ Enhanced course data structure and management
2. ✅ Course display and organization
3. ✅ User interface components

### 🔄 Core Functionality - IN PROGRESS
1. 🔄 Teacher guide upload workflow (UI complete)
2. ⏳ Guide approval and review interface
3. ⏳ Status management and tracking

### ⏳ Advanced Features - POST-MVP
1. Authentication and role management
2. External system integrations
3. Advanced analytics and reporting

# Risks and Mitigations - UPDATED
## Current Approach
- **Prototype Focus**: Building demonstrable workflows without production complexity
- **Mock Data**: Using comprehensive test data for all demonstrations
- **Simplified Architecture**: Client-side processing for MVP demo

## Post-MVP Considerations
- **Scalability**: Architecture prepared for backend integration
- **Security**: Authentication system designed but deferred
- **Integration**: API points identified for Scheduler/Xyleme connection

# Appendix - CURRENT STATUS
## ✅ Completed Implementation
