# Course Library Project - Migration Summary

## 📋 Documentation Created

I've created a comprehensive memory bank for your Course Library project. Here's what has been documented:

### 🔧 Technical Documentation
1. **`DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`** - Complete development environment specs
2. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Current project state and features
3. **`MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`** - Step-by-step migration guide
4. **`ENV_SETUP.md`** - Environment variables configuration

## 🎯 Quick Migration Overview

### Current System Profile
- **OS:** Windows 10 Pro (Build 19045)
- **Node.js:** v22.11.0
- **npm:** v10.9.0
- **Development:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Material-UI
- **AI Tools:** Taskmaster AI with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Editor:** Cursor with AI integration

### Critical Files to Preserve
- ✅ All source code in `src/` directory
- ✅ Configuration files (`.taskmasterconfig`, `package.json`, etc.)
- ✅ Task management files in `tasks/` directory
- ✅ Project documentation in `scripts/` directory
- ✅ Environment variables (API keys)

---

## 🚀 Migration Process

### Phase 1: Backup (Current Machine)
1. **Commit all changes to Git**
2. **Create project archive** 
3. **Export API keys securely**
4. **Save documentation files**

### Phase 2: Setup (New Machine)
1. **Install Node.js v22.11.0**
2. **Install Git and editors**
3. **Install global packages**
4. **Clone repository**
5. **Configure environment variables**
6. **Test development environment**

### Phase 3: Verification
1. **Test development server**
2. **Verify all features work**
3. **Test AI integration**
4. **Confirm build process**

## 🔑 Essential API Keys Required

Based on your current `.taskmasterconfig`:
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** (Primary & Fallback AI)
- **PERPLEXITY_API_KEY** (Research AI)
